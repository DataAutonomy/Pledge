# Pledge

A pledge that companies can make to their customers that ensures that their DataAutonomy is respected

## Why?

To make sure a company cannot give in to violating their users' trust in the future, it needs to 
make an Ulysses pact, that makes it impossible to renege on their promises.

The Data Autonomy Pledge is such a Ulysses pact for the users data. Like the GPL that made it
impossible to close down software, the Data Autonomy Pledge makes it impossible for a company
to run away with your data, because it is economically convenient.

## The Data Autonomy Pledge

We, [Company Name], commit ourselves to respect the Data Autonomy of our users.

To this effect we will at all times 

- Give the users exact and specific information which data we store, that is connected to them

- Give the users access to this data in electronic form in an open format we publish

- Only use the data only for specific purposes the users grant us permission for

- Only allow others to access the data who also took the Data Autonomy Pledge
